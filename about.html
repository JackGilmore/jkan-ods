<h1>About the project</h1>

<p>opendata.scot is the result of the OD_BODS project. It is entirely volunteer run and comes from a desire to help people locate and understand Open Data in Scotland better.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2> 
<p>Be the most complete and up-to-date source for locating Open Data in Scotland. 
(Starting with Local Authorities)
<li>Find: Help public users find a data source they can use.</li> 
<ul>Or submit a request/suggestion if it is missing</ul>
<li>Learn: Understand how OD is in Scotland</li>
<ul>Establish a comparable scorecard/barometer for assessing OD sources</ul>
<ul>Help identify where provision can be improved (FAIR principles)</ul>

<h2>Project Plan</h2>
<p>The plan is currently for the 12 months Oct21 - Sep22 with the intention to present the output at SODU22 and figure out next steps from there. 
See the <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods/wiki/Project-Monthly-Plan">Project Monthly Plan</a> for more detailed information</p>
