license: "The [Hands Up Scotland Survey](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/scotland/hands-up-scotland-survey)\
  \ looks at how pupils across Scotland travel to school. The project is funded by\
  \ Transport Scotland and is a joint survey between Sustrans and all 32 Scottish\
  \ local authorities. Each September, schools across Scotland complete the survey\
  \ in class by asking their pupils \u2018How do you normally travel to school?\u2019\
  . Council staff distribute the survey to schools and return pupil responses to the\
  \ Sustrans\u2019 Research and Monitoring Unit for overall collation, analysis and\
  \ reporting.\r \r The most recent results, published on 26th May 2022 in the 2021\
  \ Annual Report, provide a valuable snapshot of school travel in Scotland. The Annual\
  \ Report can be accessed by clicking on the following link:\r \r https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/projects/uk-wide/scotland/hands-up-scotland-survey\r\
