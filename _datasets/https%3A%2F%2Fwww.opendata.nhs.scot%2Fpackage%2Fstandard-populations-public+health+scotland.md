license: "There are two methods of standardising: direct and indirect. \r \r Both\
  \ methods rely upon reference to a single standard population, which has a known\
  \ population structure (in the case of direct standardisation) or known age-specific\
  \ rates (in the case of indirect standardisation). The choice of standard population\
  \ is important, as it influences the standardised rates or ratios obtained."
