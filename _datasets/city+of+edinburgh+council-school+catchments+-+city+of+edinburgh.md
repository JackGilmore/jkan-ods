notes: <p>Scottish councils usually divide towns and country areas into catchments
  and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local school.
  Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local:\r\n-
  primary non-denominational (PN), \r\n- secondary non-denominational (SN), \r\n-
  primary denominational/ Catholic (PD) and \r\n- secondary denominational/ Catholic
  (SN) schools.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains four separate layers (representing those
  above categories), which we deliver together as one single web service or zip folder.  \r\n\r\n"name"
  and "seed_code" are now MANDATORY fields for this dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </p>
