  \ The links represent an approximate central alignment of the road carriageway and\
  \ include roads classified by the National or Local Highway authority (for example,\
  \ A Roads) and unclassified roads which make up Great Britain\u2019s road network.\
  \ Attributes identify the roads that make up the Primary Route Network (PRN) and\

  \ roads used for the distribution of goods and services, and a network for the travelling\
  \ public. They are known as Trunk Roads. Whilst the PRN is made up of roads used\
  \ for transport on a regional or county level and include all roads which make up\
  \ the SRN.</p>"
