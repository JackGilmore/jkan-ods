license: "Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.\r The COVID-19 pandemic has\
  \ wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may\
  \ include:\r \r \u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\
  \ \r \u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as\
  \ some screening services and planned surgery.\r \r \u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.\r  \r This dataset provides information on trend data\
  \ regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular attendances in A&E\
  \ departments. Data is available from the beginning of 2020 along with historical\
  \ activity (average from 2018 and 2019) for comparison purposes. The recent trend\
  \ data for Accident & Emergency Department attendances are shown by age group, and\
  \ by broad area deprivation category (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD).\r\
  \ \r This data is also available on the [COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/).\r\
