  \ Health Information for Scotland (ScotPHO)](https://www.scotpho.org.uk/), show,\
  \ for all Intermediate Zones within the Stirling Council area, the estimated life\
  \ expectancy at birth for females and males expressed as a five-year average.**\r\
  \ \r **Defined by the **[**Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) Data Zone 2011**](https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/variables-classification/sns-data-zone-2011#:~:text=The%20data%20zone%20geography%20covers,around%20500%20to%201%2C000%20residents.)**\
  \ geography, Intermediate Zones are similar to Data Zones. The key difference is\
  \ their size: Intermediate Zones have a population of around 4,000 and are built\
  \ from Data Zones. Intermediate Zones are often used when the data are not suitable\
  \ for release at Data Zone level due to the sensitive nature of their content. The\
  \ larger populations of Intermediate Zones, therefore, mean that data published\
  \ are likely to require less rigorous disclosure control.**\r \r **Of the 6,976\
  \ Data Zones in Scotland, each covering a population of between 500 and 1000 residents,\
  \ there are 121 within the Stirling Council area, accounting for 24 Intermediate\
  \ Zones.**\r "
