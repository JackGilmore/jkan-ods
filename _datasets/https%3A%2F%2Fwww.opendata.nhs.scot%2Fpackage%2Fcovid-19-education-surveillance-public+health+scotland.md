  \ of educational age, education staff and educational settings. This includes:\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tTesting and cases among children and young people of educational age.\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tHospital admissions related to COVID-19 among children and young people\
  \ of educational age.\r \r \u2022\tInformation from contact tracing on cases present\
  \ in an educational setting in the 7-days before symptom onset, and on cases who\
  \ work in education or childcare.\r \r \u2022\tInformation about COVID-19 cases\
  \ in registered school pupils.\r \r This data is also available on the [COVID-19\
  \ Education Surveillance Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid19-education/_w_852fb58e/).\
  \ Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links\

  \ section of the Public Health Scotland website.\r \r __From 11/06/2021 data completeness\
  \ will be up to the previous Wednesday, so weekly data are aggregated from Thursday\
  \ to Wednesday. Previously data covered periods from Saturday to Friday. This is\
  \ due to NHS Boards submitting admission data from Monday to Friday and a three\
  \ day lag for some boards by the time data is processed for COVID-19 hospital admission.__\r\
  \ \r _From 2nd of July, information on testing and admissions will be extended to\
  \ include 20-21 years olds, and admissions will also include 18-19 year olds. From\
  \ 13th of August, information on PCR testing and admissions has been extended to\
  \ include 0-1 year olds._"
