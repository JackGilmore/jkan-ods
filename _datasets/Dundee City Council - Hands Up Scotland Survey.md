    The [Hands Up Scotland Survey](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/scotland/hands-up-scotland-survey) looks at how pupils across Scotland travel to school. The project is funded by Transport Scotland and is a joint survey between Sustrans and all 32 Scottish local authorities. Each September, schools across Scotland complete the survey in class by asking their pupils ‘How do you normally travel to school?’.
