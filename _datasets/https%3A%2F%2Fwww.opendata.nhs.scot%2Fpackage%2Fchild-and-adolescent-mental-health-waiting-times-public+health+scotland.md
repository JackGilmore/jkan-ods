license: "The main function of CAMHS is to develop and deliver services for those\
  \ children and young people (and their parents/carers) who are experiencing the\
  \ most serious mental health problems. They also have an important role in supporting\
  \ the mental health capability of the wider network of children's services. CAMHS\
  \ are usually delivered by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists,\
  \ psychologists, social workers, and others.\r \r Delivery of good quality CAMHS\
  \ depends on adequate numbers of well trained staff being recruited and retained\
  \ across NHSScotland. Practitioners who contribute to CAMHS include: psychiatric\
  \ nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers,\
  \ psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family, cognitive behavioural),\
  \ creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play therapists, liaison\
  \ teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dieticians.\r\
  \ \r Timely access to healthcare is a key measure of quality and that applies equally\
  \ in respect of access to mental health services. Early action is more likely to\
  \ result in full recovery and, in the case of children and young people, will also\
  \ minimise the impact on other aspects of their development such as their education,\
  \ so improving their wider social development outcomes.\r \r CAMHS are subject to\
  \ deliver an 18 week wait from referral to treatment for specialist services this\
  \ has been the standard since December 2014. This supersedes the previous target\
  \ of 26 weeks. The data shows the performances of the board in relation to this\
  \ standard."
