license: "A patient is termed an inpatient when they occupy a staffed bed in a hospital\
  \ and either remain overnight (whether intended or not) or are expected to remain\
  \ overnight but are discharged earlier. An inpatient\u2019s admission can be an\
  \ emergency, an elective or a transfer. A day case is when a patient makes a planned\
  \ attendance for one day to a specialty for clinical care and requires the use of\
  \ a bed (or trolley in lieu of a bed). Although a day case is usually completed\
  \ on the same day, the patient may need to be admitted as an inpatient if they are\
  \ not fit to be discharged.\r \r The residence data files relate to activity by\
  \ NHS board of residence. The treatment data files relate to activity by NHS board\
  \ of treatment.\r \r All publications and supporting material to this topic area\
  \ can be found on the [Public Health Scotland website (external website)](https://beta.isdscotland.org/topics/hospital-care/).\
  \ \r \r Further information on hospital activity can be found in the [recent quarterly\
  \ publication (external website)]( https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-quarterly/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-quarterly-quarter-ending-31-december-2021/data-summary/).\r\
