license: "This data provides a quarterly update on waiting times for people accessing\
  \ specialist drug and alcohol treatment services. In 2011, the Scottish Government\
  \ set a standard that 90% of people referred for help with problematic drug or alcohol\
  \ use will wait no longer than three weeks for specialist treatment that supports\
  \ their recovery. This data was extracted from the new Drug and Alcohol Information\
  \ System (DAISy) and its predecessor the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times\
  \ (DATWT) database. DAISy was implemented in four NHS Boards (Ayrshire & Arran,\
  \ Dumfries & Galloway, Grampian and Western Isles) from December 2020, and was available\
  \ in all NHS Boards from April 2021.\r \r All publications and supporting material\
  \ to this topic area can be found on [Public Health Scotland Substance Use page](https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/lifestyle-and-behaviours/substance-use/).\
