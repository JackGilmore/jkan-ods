license: "In order to provide an effective, safe and efficient service to patients,\
  \ hospitals must balance the provision of staffed beds against anticipated demand.\
  \ Historically, the total number of beds has been reducing in line with evolving\
  \ models of healthcare provision which aim to reduce the frequency and duration\
  \ of hospital admissions and improve the integration of health and social care services.\
  \ This strategy aims to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood\
  \ of future hospital admissions.\r \r Further information on hospital beds can be\
  \ found in the [recent annual publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/).\
  \ \r \r The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
  \ \r __As part of making our open data output align better with our annual publication\
  \ tables, we have applied column ordering to the Inpatient, Outpatient and Beds\
  \ files in the September 2021 annual open data release consistent with the publication\
  \ excel tables.__"
