notes: <p>Every local authority and National Park authority (access authorities) in
  Scotland is required to draw up a plan for a system of paths (core paths) sufficient
  for the purpose of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area. \r\n\r\nCore
  paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate, promote
  and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003,
  and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.\r\n\r\nThere are,
  intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths
  can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed
  path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and
  Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly
  available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will know what
  physical type of route they can expect. Government guidance is making core paths
  the priority for rolling out this national standardised grading system information,
  which is set out at http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/creating-paths/path-grading-system.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>
