notes: "The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development Plan\
  \ 2020 on 27 July 2020.The aim of this designation is to protect areas of strategically\
  \ important landscapes from inappropriate development. The designation also aims\
  \ to promote the highest standards of design to retain the traditional character\
  \ of these areas. There are 8 Areas of Great Landscape Value (AGLV\u2019s) in Moray.Moray\
  \ enjoys a high quality landscape and proposals which are likely to result in a\
  \ significant adverse impact on the landscape will not be supported. The creation\
  \ of new hill tracks can have a significant impact primarily from the visual appearance\
  \ of the new track, but also from the drainage and erosion effects on the local\
  \ area."
