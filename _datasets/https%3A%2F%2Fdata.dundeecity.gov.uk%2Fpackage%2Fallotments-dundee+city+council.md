license: "Allotments are plots of land that are rented by individuals or organisations\
  \ for the purpose of growing fruit, vegetables and/or flowers. There are several\
  \ allotment sites in Dundee but not all of them are run by the council itself. Dundee\
  \ City Council has four sites: Arklay Terrace, Ancrum Road, Magdalen Green and Macaulay\
  \ St. All the others are either private or devolved sites and are therefore responsible\
  \ for their own charges and waiting lists so should be contacted directly. If you\
  \ wish to be placed on the waiting list for a DCC allotment plot, please email environment@dundeecity.gov.uk\
  \ Allotment charges are currently set at \xA35.10 (\xA34.10 concession) per annum\
  \ per pole (a unit of area of about 25 m2). Allotment sizes vary slightly so the\
  \ total cost is different for each plot but a full size plot averages 10 poles and\
  \ would therefore cost about \xA351 per year."
