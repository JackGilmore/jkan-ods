license: "Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.\r \r The COVID-19 pandemic\
  \ has wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may\
  \ include:\r \r \u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\
  \ \r \u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as\
  \ some screening services and planned surgery.\r \r \u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.\r \r This dataset provides information on trend data regarding\
  \ the wider impact of the pandemic on the number of deaths in Scotland, derived\
  \ from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) [weekly deaths registration data](\
  \ https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats). Data show recent trends in deaths\
  \ (2020), whether COVID or non-COVID related, and historic trends for comparison\
  \ (five-year average, 2015-2019). The recent trend data are shown by age group and\
  \ sex, and the national data are also shown by broad area deprivation category (Scottish\
  \ Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD).\r \r This data is also available on the\
  \ [COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/).\r\
  \ Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links\
  \ section of the Metadata below. Information on COVID-19, including stay at home\
  \ advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be found on\
  \ [NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/).\r \r All publications and supporting\
  \ material to this topic area can be found in the weekly [COVID-19 Statistical Report](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/covid-19-statistical-report/).\
