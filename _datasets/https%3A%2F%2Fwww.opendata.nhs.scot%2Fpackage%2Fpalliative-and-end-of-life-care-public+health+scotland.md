license: "# Percentage of time in the last 6 months of life spent at home or in a\
  \ community setting.\r \r This data provides information in support of the Scottish\
  \ Government\u2019s [Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life\
  \ Care](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) which has one of its commitments\
  \ to \u201Csupport improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and\
  \ dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators\
  \ and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care\u201D. \r \r The percentage\
  \ of time in the last 6 months of life spent at home or in a community setting provides\
  \ a high level indication of progress in implementation of the strategic framework\
  \ for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital\
  \ setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions data) and from\
  \ this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting."
