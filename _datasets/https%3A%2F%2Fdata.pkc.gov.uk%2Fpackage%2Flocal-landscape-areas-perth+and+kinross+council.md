license: PKC designated landscapes within Perth and Kinross which merit special attention,
  either because they are of particular value and warrant protection or because they
  are degraded and require active management or positive restoration, or are under
  threat from inappropriate development. The associated LDP Landscape Supplementary
  Guidance in which they are contained was first approved by Scottish Ministers on
  17th June 2015 and readopted by Perth &amp; Kinross Council in 2020. The polygons
  were digitised by Land Use Consultants, the Consultants hired to undertake the study
  to identify the LLAs.
