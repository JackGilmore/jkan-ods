notes: "**This dataset grouping details the output from transport monitoring within\
  \ Stirling.**     \n\n**Outputs from the monitors feed into the Local Transport\
  \ Strategy (LTS) which can be accessed via Stirling Council\u2019s [website](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/).**\n\
  \n**Journey times\u2019 data are gathered using Bluetooth sensors which detect Bluetooth\
  \ devices travelling on monitored routes.**  \n\n**The devices that are used are\
  \ encrypted, and anonymise any data collected. No vehicles can be traced.** \n\n\
  **Journey times are calculated when one device is identified at two locations, this\
  \ is referred to as a Bluetooth match.**\n\n**The collection of journey times\u2019\
  \ data can be effected by different activities and conditions.**\n\n**\u2022\tThere\
  \ must be a minimum of five Bluetooth matches before the journey time can be generated**\n\
  \ \n**\u2022\tRoad closures will skew outputs as vehicles will be using alternative\
  \ routes** \n\n**\u2022\tSensors can be moved to different sites therefore results\
  \ will be zero until the locations are updated **\n\n**\u2022\tActivity of the sensors\
  \ can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are active between 7am and\
  \ 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient sunlight there can\
  \ be unprecedented periods of inactivity**\n\n**[Traffic Scotland](https://trafficscotland.org/)\
  \ can provide updates on any road closures and the [Scottish Roadworks Commissioner](https://www.roadworksscotland.org/)\
  \ can give further details on any planned roadworks throughout the country.**\n\n\
