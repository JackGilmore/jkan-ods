  \ from National Records of Scotland Sub National Population Projections - Population\
  \ Projections for Scottish Areas publication. \r \r The most recent publication\
  \ is the Population Projections for Scottish Areas (2018 based) which was published\
  \ by National Records of Scotland in March 2020.\r \r The data set contains population\
  \ projections for the period 2018 to 2043. Although National Records of Scotland\
  \ have published population projections up to 2043 they have generally only commented\
  \ on the period 2018-2028 in their analysis. Projections up to 2043 have limitations\
  \ in their use due to the level of uncertainty with projecting this far ahead. \r\
