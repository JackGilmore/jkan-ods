notes: <p>Community councils are required to be established by local authorities.
  They are the most local tier of statutory representation in Scotland. They bridge
  the gap between local authorities and communities and help to make public bodies
  aware of the opinions and needs of the communities they represent. Community councils
  are statutory consultees under various processes, such as for planning applications.\r\n\r\nThere
  are many instances where polygons do not tessellate or snap to local authority boundaries.
  The Spatial Hub processing can correct for some minor gap errors (&lt;5m) but not
  larger ones. Such gaps in the dataset mean that it cannot potentially be used for
  some kinds of spatial analysis e.g. point in polygon, because some point locations
  may fall within the gaps. These gaps either require amendment at source or approval
  for the IS to change.    \r\n\r\n"name", "url" and "status" are now MANDATORY fields
  for this dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </p>
