license: "The Hands Up Scotland Survey looks at how pupils across the country travel\
  \ to school and nursery.\r \r The project is funded by Transport Scotland and is\
  \ a joint survey between Sustrans and all 32 Scottish local authorities.\r \r Each\
  \ September, schools across Scotland complete the survey by asking their pupils\
  \ \u2018How do you normally travel to school?\u2019. Council staff distribute the\
  \ survey to schools and return pupil responses to the Sustrans\u2019 Research and\
  \ Monitoring Unit for overall collation, analysis and reporting.\r \r The most recent\
  \ results, published on 24th June 2021 in the 2020 Annual Report, provide a valuable\
  \ snapshot of school travel in Scotland."
