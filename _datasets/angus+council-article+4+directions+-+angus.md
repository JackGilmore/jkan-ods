notes: '<p>An Article 4 Direction is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning
  (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction,
  made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some
  of the permitted development rights on an area.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a Direction
  is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which
  would otherwise be regarded as ''permitted development'', i.e. development that
  does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor
  works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates,
  fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite
  antennae.\r\n\r\nArticle 4 Directions complement Conservation Areas and may overlap
  these. This dataset should be used alongside Conservation Areas when considering
  built environment heritage constraints on development.</p>'
