notes: <p>The purpose of community councils is to ascertain, co-ordinate and express
  the views of the community it represents to local authorities and other pubic bodies.
  This includes community councils appointing one person as their point of contact
  for all planning matters. Community Councils are regularly consulted by the local
  authority and public bodies on a wide range of issues which affect their area, such
  as planning, environment and health. All Community Council meetings are open to
  the public.</p>
