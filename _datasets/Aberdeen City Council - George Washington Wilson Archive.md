notes: "George Washington Wilson (1823-1893), born in **Alvah**, Aberdeenshire, was\
  \ a pioneering Scottish photographer. By the early 1850s he was established in **Aberdeen**\
  \ as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract to photograph\
  \ the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was later commissioned\
  \ to **illustrate Queen Victoria\u2019s diaries** of her time in Scotland when they\
  \ were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic\
  \ views.   \n   \nThis dataset is a list of all the items relating to **George Washington\
  \ Wilson**, his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery &\
  \ Museums. We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of, and\
  \ access to, the collection. We hope it may prove useful in identifying which photographic\
  \ images are unique across public collections in the UK but we're also keen to hear\
  \ of any novel uses this data is used for.   \n   \nFor further information or discussion,\
  \ please email [curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk](mailto:curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk).\
