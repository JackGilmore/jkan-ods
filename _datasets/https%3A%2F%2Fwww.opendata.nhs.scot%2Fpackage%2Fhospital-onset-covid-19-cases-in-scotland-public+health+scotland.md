  \ part of National Services Scotland works closely with Public Health Scotland to\
  \ deliver the COVID-19 response. This dataset provides data for COVID-19 hospital\
  \ onset cases in Scotland for week ending 1 March 2020 onwards, as available.\r\
  \ COVID-19 cases first diagnosed within hospital in-patients are classed as hospital\
  \ onset COVID-19, with the length of time between admission and the date of first\
  \ positive test of new infections or reinfection episodes (90 days from previous\
  \ COVID-19 positive result), determining their hospital onset status. \r ARHAI Scotland\
  \ is working with NHS boards on a continuous basis to validate COVID-19 hospital\
  \ onset cases to ensure the data are robust. Data are published on the Open Data\
  \ platform at NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.\r All publications and\
  \ supporting material to this topic area can be found in the weekly [Hospital onset\
  \ COVID-19 cases in Scotland publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/hospital-onset-covid-19-cases-in-scotland/).\
  \ Further information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in healthcare settings can\
  \ be found on the [Public Health Scotland website](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/).\
  \ The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
