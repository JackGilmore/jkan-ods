notes: Community Councils 2013 - 2017 (Moray). The purpose of community councils is
  to ascertain, co-ordinate and express the views of the community it represents to
  local authorities and other pubic bodies. This includes community councils appointing
  one person as their point of contact for all planning matters. Community Councils
  are regularly consulted by the local authority and public bodies on a wide range
  of issues which affect their area, such as planning, environment and health. All
  Community Council meetings are open to the public.
