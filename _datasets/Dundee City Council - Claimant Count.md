notes: '<p>The Claimant Count measures the number of people claiming benefit principally
  for the reason of being unemployed:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>from April 2015, the Claimant Count includes all Universal Credit claimants
  who are required to seek work and be available for work, as well as all JSA claimants</li>

  <li>between May 2013 and March 2015, the Claimant Count includes all out of work
  Universal Credit claimants as well as all JSA claimants</li>

  <li>between October 1996 and April 2013, the Claimant Count is a count of the number
  of people claiming Jobseeker''s Allowance (JSA)

  between January 1971 (when comparable estimates start) and September 1996, it is
  an estimate of the number of people who would have claimed unemployment-related
  benefit if Jobseeker''s Allowance had existed at that time</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The Claimant Count includes people who claim unemployment-related benefits but
  who do not receive payment. For example, some claimants will have had their benefits
  stopped for a limited period of time by Jobcentre Plus. Some people claim JSA in
  order to receive National Insurance Credits.</p>
