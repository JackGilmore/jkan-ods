license: "_From 24 March 2022, Public Health Scotland (PHS) began reporting the number\
  \ of people who have received a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Vaccine uptake\
  \ statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed\
  \ will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer\
  \ vaccination programme rolls out._\r \r _In addition, as part of our continuous\
  \ review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From\
  \ 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer\
  \ be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated\
  \ to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends\
  \ by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this table are below).\
  \  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e. including those who\
  \ have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available in the Daily Trend\
  \ of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table._\r \r _Also from 24 March 2022,\
  \ Dose 3/Booster doses are termed \u201CDose 3\u201D._\r \r **To allow new data\
  \ to be fully processed and available at 14:00, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and\
  \ COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from\
  \ 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries\
  \ made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other\
  \ times the datasets will be available in full as usual.**\r \r PHS reviewed the\
  \ JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we\
  \ derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure\
  \ we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the\
  \ list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We\
  \ have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living\
  \ population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland\
  \ have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group\
  \ uptake figures.\r \r This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed\
  \ for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken\
  \ when interpreting trends.\r \r On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine\
  \ developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national\
  \ immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved\
  \ for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January\
  \ 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout\
  \ of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.\r \r These vaccines have met strict standards\
  \ of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and\
  \ Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \r \r Those giving the vaccine to\
  \ others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme,\
  \ NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee\
  \ on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf)\
  \ and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need,\
  \ in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations\
  \ a similar approach has been adopted. \r \r Definitions used in the vaccine uptake\
  \ by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions\
  \ table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b).\
  \ Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.\r \r This dataset\
  \ provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on\
  \ the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered\
  \ and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies\
  \ (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with\
  \ time, these will be refined when updated data are available.\r \r Additional data\
  \ sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links section of the Metadata\
  \ below. \r Data visualisation and additional notes are available on the [Public\
  \ Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview).\r\
