notes: "Moray Onshore Wind Energy 2017 Policy Guidance Map for Large Typologies (Moray)\
  \ Areas of Greatest Potential. Scottish Planning Policy states that planning authorities\
  \ \u201Cshould identify where there is strategic capacity for wind farms, and areas\
  \ with the greatest potential for wind development\u201D. Areas of greatest scope\
  \ for further investigating the feasibility of developing wind farms. These areas\
  \ have been identified on Policy Guidance maps by removing additional constraints\
  \ from the spatial framework map of the areas likely to be most appropriate for\
  \ wind farm development. The remaining areas which have been mapped for each development\
  \ typology are the areas with the fewest constraints and therefore the greatest\
  \ potential for wind farm developments."
