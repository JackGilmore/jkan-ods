license: "**This dataset grouping details the output from transport monitoring within\
  \ Stirling.**     \r \r **Outputs from the monitors feed into the Local Transport\
  \ Strategy (LTS) which can be accessed via Stirling Council\u2019s [website](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/).**\r\
  \ \r **Journey times\u2019 data are gathered using Bluetooth sensors which detect\
  \ Bluetooth devices travelling on monitored routes.**  \r \r **The devices that\
  \ are used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected. No vehicles can be traced.**\
  \ \r \r **Journey times are calculated when one device is identified at two locations,\
  \ this is referred to as a Bluetooth match.**\r \r **The collection of journey times\u2019\
  \ data can be effected by different activities and conditions.**\r \r **\u2022\t\
  There must be a minimum of five Bluetooth matches before the journey time can be\
  \ generated**\r  \r **\u2022\tRoad closures will skew outputs as vehicles will be\
  \ using alternative routes** \r \r **\u2022\tSensors can be moved to different sites\
  \ therefore results will be zero until the locations are updated **\r \r **\u2022\
  \tActivity of the sensors can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are\
  \ active between 7am and 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient\
  \ sunlight there can be unprecedented periods of inactivity**\r \r **[Traffic Scotland](https://trafficscotland.org/)\
  \ can provide updates on any road closures and the [Scottish Roadworks Commissioner](https://www.roadworksscotland.org/)\
  \ can give further details on any planned roadworks throughout the country.**\r\
