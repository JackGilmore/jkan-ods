notes: '<p>This dataset reports key statistics on diagnostic waiting times as a monthly
  summary of patients waiting times for eight key diagnostic tests and investigations.</p>

  <p>Further information on diagnostic waiting times across Scotland can be found
  in the <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/nhs-waiting-times-diagnostics/">publication
  summary</a>. All publications and supporting material to this topic area can be
  found on the <a href="https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Waiting-Times/Diagnostics/">ISD
  Scotland Website</a>. A selection of information from this publication is included
  in <a href="http://www.nhsperforms.scot/">NHS Performs</a>.</p>

  <p>This publication includes a revision of March 2021 data for CT and MRI scans,
  due to a resubmission of data from NHS Western Isles. Scotland figures are therefore
  also affected. The figures for total waiting, patients waiting over six weeks, percentage
  of patients waiting over six weeks and distribution of waits for the two types of
  tests have been amended accordingly. Total radiology figures remain unaffected.</p>'
