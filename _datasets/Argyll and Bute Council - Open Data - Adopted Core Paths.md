title: Open Data - Adopted Core Paths
organization: Argyll and Bute Council
notes: >-
    Argyll &amp; Bute Council has adopted a Core Paths Plan for the Council area, to meet the requirements of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003:  It should be noted that there is a separate Core Paths Plan for those areas of Argyll that fall in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.  The Core Paths Plan was adopted by the Council on 25 June 2015 following a Local Inquiry.  Core Paths form the basic framework of paths, linking with other access provision. Any route across land or inland water can be a Core Path. The Core Paths Network as a whole should provide sufficient access opportunities for the full range of access takers, including walkers, cyclists and horse riders, of varying abilities. The network extends across the whole area with paths including trod paths across natural ground, farm and forest tracks as well as minor roads and footways beside public roads.
