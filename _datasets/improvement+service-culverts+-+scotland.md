notes: <p>Scottish legislation\xa0(Section 17) of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland)
  Act 2009 dictates that records of culverts must be created and maintained. Specifically:\n\n(1)\xa0Every
  local authority must prepare a map which shows (or more than one map which, taken
  together, show) relevant bodies of water and sustainable urban drainage systems
  in its area. \n\n(2) Each map must - \n       (a) be prepared by such date as the
  Scottish Ministers may direct, \n       (b) be prepared at a scale that the authority
  considers most appropriate, and \n       (c) contain such information and be in
  such form as the Scottish Ministers may \n            specify in regulations. \n\n(3)
  A local authority must, from time to time, review and where appropriate update the
  map (or maps) prepared for its area under subsection (1). \n\n(4) A local authority
  must make available for public inspection the map (or maps) prepared under this
  section for the time being applicable to its area. \n\n(5) In this section and section
  18 - \u201crelevant body of water\u201d - \n       (a) means - \n              (i)
  a body of surface water other than a stretch of coastal water, or \n              (ii)
  a body of underground water forming part of a watercourse (but not \n                   including
  a watercourse which is wholly underground), but \n       (b) does not include sewers
  and drains which drain into sewers, \u201csustainable \n            urban drainage
  system\u201d has the meaning given in section 59(1) of the \n            Sewerage
  (Scotland) Act 1968 (c.47).\n\nMost Local Authorities have contributed (natural)
  culvert data to the new OS MasterMap Water Network Layer\xa0either through providing
  data to the Scottish Government or through the James Hutton Institute. As this data
  is now live, a mechanism for managing/maintaining/updating this data needs to be
  put in place. SCOTS (Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland) have
  approved\xa0for this dataset to be managed by the Spatial Hub and any amended data
  can be\xa0uploaded (and potentially downloaded)\xa0before being shared with OSMA
  members and the OS.\n\nWe have initially created a point and line data layer representing
  the data we have been sent by some LAs. However, we really need line data in order
  for it to be merged into the OS MasterMap Water Network Layer data in due course.
  \n\nThe LA "culverts" data as included in the OS MasterMap Water Network Layer is
  also available for LAs to download and use as part of this dataset</p>
