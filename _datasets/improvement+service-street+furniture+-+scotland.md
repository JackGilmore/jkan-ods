notes: <p>In November 2004, Audit Scotland published a document entitled \u2018Maintaining
  Scotland\u2019s Roads\u2019, effectively introducing a requirement on local authorities
  in Scotland to produce a Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP). Following this publication,
  The Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) produced a
  common asset management framework through which all local authorities could develop
  their own RAMP. Street assets/furniture are a key part of the RAMP and as such a
  requirement exists for a national dataset of information. This can include (although
  is not limited to) features such as bollards, road signs, barriers, parking bays,
  bus shelters, cattle grids, gates, street lighting columns, benches/seats, information
  boards, dog/litter/grit bins, cycle stands, ticket machines etc. etc.\n\nWe are
  currently only including furniture types that have been provided by more than one
  council. These are:\nGrit Bins\nStreet Lights\nTraffic Calming\nTraffic Signals\nLitter
  Bins\nCattle Grids\nWeather Stations\nDog Litter Bins\nBenches\nBollards\nPicnic
  Tables\nMemorials\nCycle parking\nElectric Vehicle Charging Points\n\nWe understand
  that some local authorities are loading this data into the VAULT system. We will
  work with the team managing that system to ensure that there is one definitive list
  in the future.</p>
