license: "Patients who require the medical opinion of a specialist clinician may be\
  \ referred to an outpatient clinic for treatment or investigation. An outpatient\
  \ is a patient who attends a consultant or other medical clinic or has an arranged\
  \ meeting with a consultant or a senior member of their team outside of a clinic\
  \ session. Outpatients are not admitted to a hospital and do not use a hospital\
  \ bed.\r \r Outpatient attendances can be categorised as new or follow-up (return)\
  \ attendances. Information on return appointments is only available for datasets\
  \ that report on NHS board of treatment. Files reporting on the residency of patients\
  \ only contain data for new outpatients as the ISD(S)1 data source for return outpatients\
  \ does not contain residence information. ISD(S)1 also does not record information\
  \ on the deprivation, age or sex of patients.\r \r All publications and supporting\
  \ material to this topic area can be found on the [Public Health Scotland website\
  \ (external website)](https://beta.isdscotland.org/topics/hospital-care/). \r \r\
  \ Further information on hospital activity can be found in the [recent quarterly\
  \ publication (external website)]( https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-quarterly/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-quarterly-quarter-ending-31-december-2021/data-summary/).\r\
