license: "This dataset presents information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to\
  \ pregnant women in Scotland.\r \r In Scotland the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been\
  \ used since the start of the vaccination programme on 8 December 2020. The Oxford/Astrazeneca\
  \ vaccine has been used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April\
  \ 2021. \r \r Women can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19\
  \ vaccination during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination\
  \ and how this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.\r \r PHS has generated this\
  \ information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national\
  \ data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database\
  \ of pregnant women in Scotland.\r \r As part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly\
  \ linking together a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or\
  \ recently have been, pregnant.  The specific records used include:\r \r - Records\
  \ of booking for antenatal care\r - GP records relating to miscarriage\r - Hospital\
  \ discharge records relating to miscarriage or delivery of a live or stillborn baby\r\
  \ - Statutory termination of pregnancy notification records\r - Statutory live or\
  \ stillbirth registration records\r - NHS live birth notification records.\r \r\
  \ Using these records, we have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant\
  \ on 1 March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently\
  \ become pregnant.  \r \r The study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies\
  \ added to the database, and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as\
  \ required, for example if a woman has recently delivered her baby.\r \r Further\
  \ details on the COPS study are available on the [Usher Institute webpage](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/covid-19-pregnancy-scotland)\
  \ and [PHS github page](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public).\r\
