license: "George Washington Wilson (1823-1893), born in **Alvah**, Aberdeenshire,\
  \ was a pioneering Scottish photographer. By the early 1850s he was established\
  \ in **Aberdeen** as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract\
  \ to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and\
  \ was later commissioned to **illustrate Queen Victoria\u2019s diaries** of her\
  \ time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed\
  \ on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   \r    \r This dataset is a list of all\
  \ the items relating to **George Washington Wilson**, his company and successor\
  \ companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums. We are releasing it as open\
  \ data to increase public awareness of, and access to, the collection. We hope it\
  \ may prove useful in identifying which photographic images are unique across public\
  \ collections in the UK but we're also keen to hear of any novel uses this data\
  \ is used for.   \r    \r For further information or discussion, please email [curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk](mailto:curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk).\
