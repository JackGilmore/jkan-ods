notes: "As part of an exciting collaboration with Dundee Place Partnership, [Creative\
  \ Dundee](https://creativedundee.com/) has been doing some research and consultation\
  \ to find out more about the cultural and creative happenings across the city. For\
  \ 5 months, they have been to many of Dundee\u2019s community hubs and events with\
  \ a big map of the city where people could pin down their favourite places to go,\
  \ and fill a short survey about the activities they like doing in their free time\
  \ and what they\u2019d like to see happening across the city. The places are shared\
  \ in this dataset. Read more about the research and see other results on Creative\
  \ Dundee's website. "
