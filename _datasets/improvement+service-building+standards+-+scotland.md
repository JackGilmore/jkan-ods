notes: <p>A Building Standards Register is maintained by local authorities under the
  terms of Section 24 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Local authorities are responsible
  for granting permission for work to be done (building warrant) and for a completed
  building to be occupied (completion certificate). These registers are online and
  searchable and published as weekly lists in a similar way to planning applications.\n\nRegisters
  typically contain details of applications at the following stages of the building
  warrant process:\n\n- Received\n- Decided\n- Commenced\n- Completed\n\nThe datasets
  are presented as follows:\n\n1. Building Standards - Weekly Lists (Points):\xa0\xa0A
  point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists
  for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or
  decided by a local authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland
  using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding\xa0geometry. This is categorised
  by application status, local authority and date of weekly list.\n2. Building Standards
  - Weekly Lists (Polygons):\xa0A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current
  calendar year's weekly lists for most Scottish\xa0local authorities in terms of\xa0applications
  registered and/or decided by a local authority. This is only for authorities that
  publish site boundary\xa0mapping data online.\xa0This is\xa0categorised\xa0by application
  status, local authority and date of weekly list.\n3. Building Standards - historic
  year layers (Points):\xa0Point layer for all previous year's building standards
  applications with summary details for\xa0most\xa0Scottish\xa0local\xa0authorities.
  This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or
  postcode as corresponding\xa0geometry.\n4. Building Standards - historic year layers
  (Polygons):\xa0Polygon layers for all previous year's building standards applications
  with summary details for\xa0most\xa0Scottish\xa0local\xa0authorities. This is only
  for authorities that publish site boundary\xa0mapping data online and is not complete
  across Scotland.\n\nThis data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists)
  and this metadata record is updated weekly.\n\nWe strongly recommend that, when
  using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.\n\n<em>Moray
  and Aberdeenshire's data has currently been removed from this dataset. We will find
  a solution to this in due course</em></p>
