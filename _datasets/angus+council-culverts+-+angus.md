notes: <p>Scottish legislation (Section 17) of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland)
  Act 2009 dictates that records of culverts must be created and maintained. Specifically;\r\n\r\n(1)
  Every local authority must prepare a map which shows (or more than one map which,
  taken together, show) relevant bodies of water and sustainable urban drainage systems
  in its area.\r\n\r\n(2) Each map must;\r\n\r\n(a) be prepared by such date as the
  Scottish Ministers may direct,\r\n\r\n(b) be prepared at a scale that the authority
  considers most appropriate, and\r\n\r\n(c) contain such information and be in such
  form as the Scottish Ministers may specify in regulations.\r\n\r\n(3) A local authority
  must, from time to time, review and where appropriate update the map (or maps) prepared
  for its area under subsection (1).\r\n\r\n(4) A local authority must make available
  for public inspection the map (or maps) prepared under this section for the time
  being applicable to its area.\r\n\r\n(5) In this section and section 18 relevant
  body of water\r\n\r\n(a) means;\r\n\r\n(i) a body of surface water other than a
  stretch of coastal water, or\r\n\r\n(ii) a body of underground water forming part
  of a watercourse (but not including a watercourse which is wholly underground),
  but\r\n\r\n(b) does not include sewers and drains which drain into sewers, sustainable
  urban drainage system has the meaning given in section 59(1) of the Sewerage (Scotland)
  Act 1968 (c.47).\r\n\r\nMost Local Authorities have contributed (natural) culvert
  data to the new OS MasterMap Water Network Layer either through providing data to
  the Scottish Government or through the James Hutton Institute. As this data is now
  live, a mechanism for managing/maintaining/updating this data needs to be put in
  place. SCOTS (Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland) have approved
  for this dataset to be managed by the Spatial Hub and any amended data can be uploaded
  (and potentially downloaded)  before being shared with OSMA members and the OS.\r\n\r\nTHIS
  DATA NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED AS A LINE FORMAT\r\n\r\nUnique feature name is now a mandatory
  attribute for this dataset.</p>
