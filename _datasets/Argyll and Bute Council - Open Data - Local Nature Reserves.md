notes: <p>LNRs are established in a variety of locations with very varied habitats
  and species. They must lie wholly within the area of jurisdiction of the local authority
  which declares them to be reserves. Prior to such declaration, the local authority
  must own or lease the site or obtain an agreement from the owner. LNRs are generally
  smaller than NNRs and closer to centres of population. They are frequently provided
  for the enjoyment and education of local people whose involvement in site management
  is encouraged.</p>
