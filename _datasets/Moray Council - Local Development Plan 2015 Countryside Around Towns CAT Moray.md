title: Local Development Plan 2015 Countryside Around Towns (CAT) (Moray)
organization: Moray Council
notes: >-
    The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development Plan 2020 on 27 July 2020.The five main towns of Elgin, Forres, Buckie, Keith and Lossiemouth are subject to the highest development pressures and Countryside Around Towns (CAT’s) have been designated to prevent development sprawl into the countryside. Only certain types of development are appropriate within CAT’s to protect their special character. New housing development is specifically excluded from the types of acceptable development to maintain and preserve the distinction with the built up area.
