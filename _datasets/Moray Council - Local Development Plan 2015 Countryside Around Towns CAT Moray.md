notes: "The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development Plan\
  \ 2020 on 27 July 2020.The five main towns of Elgin, Forres, Buckie, Keith and Lossiemouth\
  \ are subject to the highest development pressures and Countryside Around Towns\
  \ (CAT\u2019s) have been designated to prevent development sprawl into the countryside.\
  \ Only certain types of development are appropriate within CAT\u2019s to protect\
  \ their special character. New housing development is specifically excluded from\
  \ the types of acceptable development to maintain and preserve the distinction with\
  \ the built up area."
