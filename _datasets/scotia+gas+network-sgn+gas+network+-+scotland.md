notes: '<p>SGN create 4 separate data layers (by pressure tier) to depict the location
  of their gas network:\nLP           - Low Pressure (19 mbar - 75 mbar)\nMP         -
  Medium Pressure (75mbar - 2 bar)\nIP            - Intermediate Pressure (2 bar -
  7 bar)\nHP          - Regional High Pressure (&gt;7 bar)\n\nThe gas network data
  is up to date at the time of publication, but it is given without warranty as to
  the accuracy of the information shown.  Service pipes, valves, siphons, sub-connections
  etc. are not shown but their presence should be anticipated.  No liability of any
  kind whatsoever is accepted by SGN or its agents, servants or sub-contractors for
  any error or omission.  \n\nShould the user wish to excavate in the vicinity of
  pipelines, the User should visit SGN via sgn.co.uk/Safety/Dig-safely for further
  information. SGN use an on-line mapping system, accessible via the sgn.co.uk/Safety/Dig-safely
  web pages or linesearchbeforeudig.co.uk, this process should be used to obtain up
  to date maps and safety information before you excavate.  However if you need more
  information please contact our Safety Admin team on 0800 912 1722 or by email: plantlocation@sgn.co.uk.\n\nFor
  the avoidance of doubt, safe digging practices, in accordance with HS (G) 47, must
  be used to verify and establish the actual position of mains, pipes, services and
  other apparatus on site before any mechanical plant is used.  It is your responsibility
  to ensure that this information is provided to all persons (whether direct labour
  or contractors) working for you on or near gas apparatus.\n\nMains shown in the
  data are those owned by SGN by virtue of being a licensed Gas Transporter (GT).  Gas
  pipes owned by other GT\u2019s, or third parties, may also be present in the area
  and are not shown in the data.  Information with regard to such pipes should be
  obtained from the relevant owners</p>'
