notes: <p>Scottish councils usually divide towns and country areas into catchments
  and children living in a catchment area will usually go to the same local school.
  Domestic properties typically have a catchment area for each of their local:\n-
  primary non-denominational (PN), \n- secondary non-denominational (SN), \n- primary
  denominational/ Catholic (PD) and \n- secondary denominational/ Catholic (SN) schools.\n\nThis
  dataset contains four separate layers (representing those above categories), which
  we deliver together as one single web service or zip folder.\n\nThese data layers
  do not contain the catchment areas for Jordanhill primary and secondary school catchments
  which is located in west Glasgow. This is because it is a Scottish Government-funded
  school. This data will be provided by other data publishers in due course.</p>
