license: "The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is the Scottish Government\u2019\
  s official tool for identifying places in Scotland suffering from deprivation. Deprivation\
  \ in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of\
  \ resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing\
  \ and access to services as well as financial aspects. \r \r The most recent Scottish\
  \ Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government on 31st\
  \ August 2016. The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones\
  \ with roughly an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then\
  \ look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data\
  \ zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment\
  \ etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains.\
  \ These domains are:\r \r \u2022\tIncome\r \u2022\tEmployment\r \u2022\tEducation\r\
  \ \u2022\tHealth\r \u2022\tAccess to Services\r \u2022\tCrime\r \u2022\tHousing\
  \ \r \r The 7 domains are combined into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland\
  \ from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations\
  \ to target policies and place resources in the areas with greatest need. \r \r\
  \ The boundaries used to collate the SIMD changed in 2016 as the analysis was based\
  \ on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government.  The previous\
  \ SIMD\u2019s published by the Scottish Government were based on the Scottish Governments\
  \ 2001 based data zones. This means that the data zones used in the 2016 SIMD are\
  \ not directly comparable with previous data zones.\r \r This dataset shows SIMD\
  \ 2016 data for Dundee City. This is broken down to data zone and intermediate zone\
  \ level. There are currently 188 data zones in Dundee City.\r \r The data is sourced\
  \ from Scottish Government - Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2016. The full\
  \ dataset is available on the Scottish Government website which can be accessed\
  \ from the link below:\r https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD\r \r The Scottish\
  \ Government have produced some useful documents to assist greater understanding\
  \ of the SIMD. \r SIMD 2016 Introduction Booklet: https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0050/00504809.pdf\r\
