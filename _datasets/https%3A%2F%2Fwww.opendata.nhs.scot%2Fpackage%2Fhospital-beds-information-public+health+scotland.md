  \ must balance the provision of staffed beds against anticipated demand. Historically,\
  \ the total number of beds has been reducing in line with evolving models of healthcare\
  \ provision which aim to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital admissions\
  \ and improve the integration of health and social care services. This strategy\
  \ aims to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood of future hospital\
  \ admissions.\r \r All publications and supporting material to this topic area can\
