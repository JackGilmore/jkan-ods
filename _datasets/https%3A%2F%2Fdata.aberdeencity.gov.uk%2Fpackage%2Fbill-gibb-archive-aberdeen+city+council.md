license: "Bill Gibb (1943-1988), born in **New Pitsligo**, Aberdeenshire, was an **international\
  \ fashion designer** with world famous clients. In 1970, at the start of his career,\
  \ one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two\
  \ years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his\
  \ first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their\
  \ startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear\
  \ designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women.\
  \ Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such\
  \ as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for\
  \ private clients until his death.   \r    \r In 1997 his archive of sketched designs\
  \ and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help\
  \ from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**.\
  \ We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill\
  \ Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other\
  \ items associated with him.   \r    \r To discover the full extent of the collection\
  \ and see images search for Bill Gibb on the [Art Gallery Catalogue](http://www.aagm.co.uk/TheCollections/BasicSearch.aspx?dosearch=y&Artists=Gibb+Bill&Title=&chat=)\
  \ (please note, all images are \xA9 Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums Collections).\
  \  This dataset lists all the Bill Gibb items in the collection database.  We are\
  \ releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of Bill Gibb, and increase\
  \ access to this collection.  We are keen to hear of any novel uses this data is\
  \ used for.  For further information or discussion, please email [curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk](mailto:curators@aberdeencity.gov.uk)."
