license: "Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time\
  \ critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout\
  \ the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support\
  \ other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed\
  \ in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow\
  \ services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff\
  \ may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.\r \r Guidance issued by\
  \ the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\
  \ to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tIt may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option\
  \ for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery\
  \ care within obstetric units.\r \r \u2022\tAdditional restrictions on the use of\
  \ water births were recommended.\r \r \u2022\tCare pathways for women requiring\
  \ induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction\
  \ process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible.\r \r \u2022\t\
  Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean\
  \ section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact\
  \ with a case, if it was safe to do so.\r \r \u2022\tServices should support low\
  \ risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible.\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tIn general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital\
  \ were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen\
  \ birth partner.\r \r The \u2018method of delivery' refers to the way a baby is\
  \ born. Different methods of delivery include spontaneous vaginal delivery (a natural\
  \ birth); assisted vaginal delivery (including vaginal delivery by forceps or ventouse,\
  \ or vaginal delivery of a breech baby); or a caesarean section (an operation to\
  \ deliver the baby through a cut in the mother\u2019s abdomen). A caesarean section\
  \ can be elective (planned in advance and provided before labour has started) or\
  \ emergency (unplanned, and usually but not always provided after labour has started).\r\
  \ \r This dataset shows information on method of delivery at Scotland and  NHS Board\
  \ level. Age and deprivation breakdown is also available at Scotland level. \r \r\
