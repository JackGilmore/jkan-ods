notes: '<div style=''text-align:Left;font-size:12pt''><p><span>Adopted at March 2020,
  the strategy provides a strategic framework for the development of forest and woodland
  in Perth and Kinross (2014-2024) and sets out a local interpretation of the Scottish
  Forestry Strategy.  It will be used to inform development management decisions that
  involve woodland creation and woodland removal alongside other relevant information.  The
  Strategy is a land use plan to help identify areas where proposals for woodland
  creation and management may be supported and activities that will be encouraged
  through available funding.   The extent to which specific proposals in potential
  areas will be supported will depend on site specific criteria detailed with in action
  plans,  individual forest management plans, the Forest Design Framework etc.  The
  design of schemes will require careful consideration.  (For further detail see http://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=28220&amp;p=0)</span></p><p><span>CLASS:</span></p><p><span>PREFERRED:  Land
  will be that which offers the greatest scope to accommodate future expansion of
  a range of woodland types, and hence, to deliver on a very wide range of objectives.
  Within preferred areas sensitivities are, in general, likely to be limited, and
  it should be possible to address any particular site specific issues within well
  designed proposals that meet the UK Forestry Standard and associated guidelines.
  Most expansion is therefore likely to be focused on preferred areas.</span></p><p><span>POTENTIAL:  Land
  will be that which offers considerable potential to accommodate future expansion
  of a range of woodland types, but where at least one significant sensitivity exists.
  The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas will be supported will
  depend on how well sensitivities can be addressed within the proposals. The design
  of schemes will require careful consideration</span></p><p><span>SENSITIVE:  Areas
  where a combination of sensitivities means there will be limited scope to accommodate
  further woodland expansion unless that expansion demonstrably does not impact negatively
  on the identified sensitivity. Limited woodland expansion may be possible within
  sensitive areas where it is of a scale and character which can be accommodated without
  significant negative impacts and/or where it would positively enhance the features
  of interest locally. In some areas cumulative impact may also be a relevant consideration.</span></p><p><span>UNSUITABLE:  Areas
  assessed as being physically unsuitable for the growth and management of trees (based
  on the Land Capability for Forestry Map)</span></p></div>'
