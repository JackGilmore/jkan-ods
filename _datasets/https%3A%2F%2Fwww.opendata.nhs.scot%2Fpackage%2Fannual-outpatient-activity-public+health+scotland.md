license: "Patients who require the medical opinion of a specialist clinician may be\
  \ referred to an outpatient clinic for treatment or investigation. An outpatient\
  \ is a patient who attends (outpatient attendance) a consultant or other medical\
  \ clinic, or has an arranged meeting with a consultant or a senior member of their\
  \ team outwith a clinic session. Outpatients are not admitted to a hospital and\
  \ do not use a hospital bed.\r \r Outpatient attendances can be categorised as new\
  \ or follow-up (return) attendances. Information on return appointments is only\
  \ available for datasets that report on NHS Board of Treatment. Files reporting\
  \ on the residency of patients only contain data for new outpatients as the ISD(S)1\
  \ data source for return outpatients does not contain residence information. ISD(S)1\
  \ also does not record information on the deprivation, age or sex of patients.\r\
  \ \r A variety of operations are carried out in NHSScotland and, increasingly, less\
  \ complex procedures are undertaken in an outpatient setting. For further information\
  \ on these procedures, see the [Operations/Procedures](https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/health-services/hospital-care/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/29-september-2020)\
  \ section of the Public Health Scotland website.\r \r Further information on hospital\
  \ activity can be found in the [recent annual publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/).\
  \ \r \r The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
  \ \r __As part of making our open data output align better with our annual publication\
  \ tables, we have added health board of treatment column and qualifier columns (HB,\
  \ HBQF) to the \u201CInpatient and Day case\u201D and \u201COutpatient\u201D files\
  \ which have a breakdown by Location of Treatment.__\r \r __As part of making our\
  \ open data output align better with our annual publication tables, we have applied\
  \ new column ordering to the Inpatient, Outpatient and Beds files in the September\
  \ 2021 annual open data release consistent with the publication excel tables.__"
