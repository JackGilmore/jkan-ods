notes: "<p><strong>Update from 10/02/2022 onwards</strong>: There have been changes\
  \ to the way we publish the LFD and PCR data. Previously they were contained in\
  \ their own resources, but from the 10th the other resources will incorporate this\
  \ data, and the three standalone \"Combined cases\" resources will no longer be\
  \ updated. Additionally, test numbers are no longer reported, as well as number\
  \ of negative tests. Read more about this approach <a href=\"https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/news/2022/february/update-on-enhancements-to-covid-19-reporting/\"\
  >here</a>. </p>\n<p>To allow new data to be fully processed and available at 14:00,\
  \ the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will\
  \ be temporarily unavailable from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets\
  \ will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013\
  \ Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as\
  \ usual.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on number of new daily confirmed\
  \ cases, negative cases, deaths, testing by NHS Labs (Pillar 1) and UK Government\
  \ (Pillar 2), new hospital admissions and new ICU admissions from novel coronavirus\
  \ (COVID-19) in Scotland, including cumulative totals and population rates at Scotland,\
  \ NHS Board and Council Area levels (where possible). Seven day positive cases and\
  \ population rates are also presented by Neighbourhood Area (Intermediate Zone 2011).\
  \ Information on how PHS publish small are COVID figures is available on the <a\

  >PHS website</a>. </p>\n<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus\
  \ first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate\
  \ illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared\
  \ a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread\
  \ of COVID-19 within communities in the UK.</p>\n<p>Information on COVID-19, including\
