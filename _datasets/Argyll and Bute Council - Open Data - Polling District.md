notes: "A \u2018polling district\u2019 is a geographical subdivision of an electoral\
  \ area such as an electoral Ward within which a polling place is designated.The\
  \ Representation of the People Act 1983 places a duty on LA to divide the local\
  \ authority area into polling districts based on ward boundaries, and to designate\
  \ a polling place for each district. LAs also have a duty to keep these polling\
  \ arrangements under review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments\
  \ to the 1983 Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration\
  \ Act 2013). Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation)\
  \ of its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments\
  \ to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within\
  \ LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries\
  \ or to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling\
  \ places"
