license: "The Place Standard is used to evaluate the quality of a \u201Cplace\u201D\
  . It can evaluate places that are well-established, undergoing change, or still\
  \ being planned. The tool can also help users to identify their  priorities. This\
  \ was one of the main methods used by Community Regeneration staff and partner organisations\
  \ to inform the Engage Dundee consultation which was undertaken between June 2016\
  \ and March 2017.\r \r Findings from the Engage Dundee consultation will directly\
  \ inform the key priorities in Local Community Plans currently being developed in\
  \ each multi-member Ward. The consultation was also used to identify priorities\
  \ to inform the Local Outcome Improvement Plan and potentially how the new Community\
  \ Infrastructure Fund is allocated.\r \r The survey consisted of questions which\
  \ cover both the physical and social elements of a \u201Cplace.\u201D. \r \r You\
  \ can read more about the results in the [Engage Dundee summary leaflet](\"http://www.dundeepartnership.co.uk/sites/default/files/Engage%20Dundee%20PR%20summary.pdf\"\
