notes: <p>Most councils will keep a record of their car parks, bays and zones (including
  parking-related TROs (Traffic Regulation Orders). Therefore we have tried to compile
  these into consistent national layers.\n\nCurrently, we publish five layers:\n-
  Car Parks - a polygon layer\n- Car Parks - a point layer\n- Parking Bays - a polygon
  layer\n- Parking Zones - a polygon layer\n\nAny supplied line records (usually TROs)
  have been buffered by 2m to create a representative area and incorporate them into
  the national polygon layers.\n\nMany partially populated attributes are currently
  published. However, we will look to rationalise this list in future iterations.</p>
