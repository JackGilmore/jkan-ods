notes: "Neighbourhood Representative Structures are supported and recognised by Dundee\
  \ City Council in a similar way to Community Councils, and both have a right to\
  \ consultation on matters relating to their neighbourhood. This dataset shows the\
  \ active neighbourhood representation that the Council consults with across the\
  \ City.\n\nFor Community Council boundaries only see the related Community Council\
  \ Wards dataset. \n\nBackground on the formation and recognition of Neighbourhood\
  \ Representative Structures is available in the Neighbourhood Resource and Development\
  \ Committee report number 752-2002."
