notes: Local Development Plan Rural Group Sites have been set out within many of the
  Local Development Plan Rural Groupings. Sites with development potential have been
  identified. These are acceptable in principle subject to compliance with the Moray
  Local Development Plan (MLDP) 2020, but will still require confirmation of technical
  requirements (eg road access; drainage).These designations do not imply any right
  of access or use of private land, nor do they commit the Council to any form of
  maintenance or upkeep of the site.
