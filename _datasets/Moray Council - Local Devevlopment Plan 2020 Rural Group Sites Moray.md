title: Local Devevlopment Plan 2020 Rural Group Sites (Moray)
organization: Moray Council
notes: >-
    Local Development Plan Rural Group Sites have been set out within many of the Local Development Plan Rural Groupings. Sites with development potential have been identified. These are acceptable in principle subject to compliance with the Moray Local Development Plan (MLDP) 2020, but will still require confirmation of technical requirements (eg road access; drainage).These designations do not imply any right of access or use of private land, nor do they commit the Council to any form of maintenance or upkeep of the site.
