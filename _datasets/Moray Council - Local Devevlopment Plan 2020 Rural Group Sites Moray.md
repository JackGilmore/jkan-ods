notes: <p>Local Development Plan Rural Group Sites have been set out within many of
  the Local Development Plan Rural Groupings. Sites with development potential have
  been identified. These are acceptable in principle subject to compliance with the
  Moray Local Development Plan (MLDP) 2020, but will still require confirmation of
  technical requirements (eg road access; drainage).These designations do not imply
  any right of access or use of private land, nor do they commit the Council to any
  form of maintenance or upkeep of the site.</p>
