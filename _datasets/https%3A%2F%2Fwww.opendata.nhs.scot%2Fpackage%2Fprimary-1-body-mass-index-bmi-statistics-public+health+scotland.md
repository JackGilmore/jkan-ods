license: "Primary 1 Body Mass Index (BMI) statistics capture important information\
  \ of the growth of young children. Data are presented by: NHS health board, council\
  \ area, deprivation and sex.\r \r A [full publication report](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/primary-1-body-mass-index-bmi-statistics-scotland/)\
  \ and [technical report](https://publichealthscotland.scot/media/6548/2020-12-15-p1-bmi-statistics-technical-report.pdf)\
  \ are available. \r \r All publications and supporting material to this topic area\
  \ can be found on the [PHS Scotland - Child Health Website](https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/child-health/).\
  \ The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
  \ \r The Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coverage of P1 reviews\
  \ in 2019/20 as many of these had not been carried out prior to the closure of schools\
  \ in March. Analysis of reviews for 2019/20 has shown that the Scotland level data\
  \ is broadly representative of a \u2018normal\u2019 school year, nonetheless the\
  \ low coverage means that Scotland level results shown should be treated with a\
  \ degree of caution. Analysis of BMI distribution is shown for individual NHS Boards\
  \ and local authorities where the coverage exceeds 50%, but is not shown for the\
  \ areas with low coverage. \r "
