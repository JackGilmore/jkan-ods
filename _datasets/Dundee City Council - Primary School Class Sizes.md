notes: >-
    Data on class sizes in primary schools - giving the number of pupils in each class in September of the given year. From the annual pupil census in publicly funded schools in Scotland. Filtered from the [national dataset](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/dspupcensus) to include schools within Dundee City only. Class size data is not collected for secondary school as class size varies widely across subjects. 

    * "Class type" gives the stage of pupils in the class or, where more than one stage is present.
    * "Co" denotes a composite class.
    * In a class where there are two or more teachers then 'Two or More Teachers' will have a value of '1'.
    * '*' indicates where data has been suppressed for confidentiality reasons where <5 pupils could be identified.
