notes: <p>A Polling District is a geographical subdivision of an electoral area such
  as an electoral Ward within which a polling place is designated.\r\n\r\nThe Representation
  of the People Act 1983 places a duty on LA to divide the local authority area into
  polling districts based on ward boundaries, and to designate a polling place for
  each district. LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements under review.
  The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the 1983 Act (which
  in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act 2013). Now local
  authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation) of its polling
  districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments to the boundaries
  of polling districts and the designation of polling places within LA wards can be
  proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries or to the availability
  of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling places.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth
  Review of Electoral Arrangements concluded in May 2016 when the LGBCS made recommendations
  to Scottish Ministers for the number of Councillors and the electoral ward boundaries
  in each of Scotland's 32 local authorities. The review recommended changes in 30
  LA areas of which all but 5 were accepted and came into force on 30th Sept 2016.
  As a result, ward boundaries (and therefore polling districts and possibly polling
  places) were changed after this date in time for the May 2017 elections.\r\n\r\nThe
  following fields are now MANDATORY fields for this dataset.\r\n"district_code" -
  The polling district code, as defined by the LA\r\n"UPRN" - The Unique Property
  Reference Number for the Corporate Address Gazeteer record of the polling place
  related to the polling district, as defined by the LA\r\n"polling_place" - The name
