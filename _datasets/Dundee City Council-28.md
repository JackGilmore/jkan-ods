notes: '<p>Energy usage recorded every half hour for primary and high schools in Dundee
  City. Data is given for gas and electricity usage and is the summation of readings
  taken from one or more meters within individual schools. To consider when looking
  at energy usage for individual schools: </p>

  <ul>

  <li>School buildings and facilities noticeably vary. Some schools use older buildings
  which limit their energy efficiency. Some schools have swimming pools or other facilities
  that lead to a higher energy usage.</li>

  <li>School sizes differ considerably, as do the number of attending pupils and staff.</li>

  <li>Schools may be used during the evening and weekends for after-school clubs,
  community activities and other events. Schools may also be used in the mornings
  for breakfast clubs.</li>

  <li>Weather conditions affect the amount of energy used by schools.</li>

  <li>All the above factors and more can change the energy usage profile of the school
  and should be considered when viewing the data.</li>
