license: "Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time\
  \ critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout\
  \ the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support\
  \ other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed\
  \ in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow\
  \ services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff\
  \ may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.\r \r Guidance issued by\
  \ the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\
  \ to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tIt may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option\
  \ for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery\
  \ care within obstetric units\r \r \u2022\tAdditional restrictions on the use of\
  \ water births were recommended\r \r \u2022\tCare pathways for women requiring induction\
  \ of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process\
  \ were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible\r \r \u2022\tServices\
  \ should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean\
  \ section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact\
  \ with a case, if it was safe to do so\r \r \u2022\tServices should support low\
  \ risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible\r\
  \ \r \u2022\tIn general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital\
  \ were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen\
  \ birth partner\r \r 'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given a medical intervention\
  \ to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously. It\
  \ is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered safer (for\
  \ the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past her \u2018\
  due date\u2019. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for example using\
  \ medicines, a medical \u2018balloon\u2019 device that sits at the neck of the womb,\
  \ and/or breaking the woman\u2019s waters.\r \r This dataset shows information on\
  \ induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland level\
  \ data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information\
  \ on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge\
  \ records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton\
  \ live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up\
  \ to 3 weeks before or after their due date).\r \r This data is also available on\
  \ the [COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/).\
