license: "As an essential service, care relating to termination of pregnancy has been\
  \ provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Termination of pregnancy can be carried\
  \ out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations\
  \ involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her\
  \ pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required\
  \ to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately,\
  \ the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination\
  \ (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine\
  \ away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that\
  \ at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring\
  \ an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been\
  \ able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then\
  \ take both medicines at home.\r \r Termination of pregnancy (also referred to as\
  \ a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion\
  \ Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a\
  \ termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the\
  \ Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place.\
  \ Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications\
  \ of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed\
  \ information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland.\
  \ The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.\r \r This dataset presents\
  \ information on the number of terminations of pregnancy carried out in Scotland,\
  \ and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which they occurred. Data is\
  \ shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and\
  \ deprivation. \r \r This data is also available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard.\
