  \ 2015, with the results used to add or update cycle parking in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).\
  \ \n\nThis dataset is an extract of the current cycle parking in OpenStreetMap.\
  \ If you see a facility missing or would like to update any of the information you\
  \ can do this on OpenStreetMap yourself. "
