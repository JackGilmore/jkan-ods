license: "Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. \r \r The COVID-19 pandemic\
  \ has wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\r Reasons for this may\
  \ include:\r \r \u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.\r\
  \ \r \u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as\
  \ some screening services and planned surgery.\r \r \u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.\r \r This dataset provides information on trend data regarding\
  \ the wider impact of the pandemic on Primary Care Out of Hours cases. The Primary\
  \ Care Out of Hours service provides urgent access to a nurse or doctor, when needed\
  \ at times outside normal general practice hours, such as evenings, overnight or\
  \ during the weekend. An appointment to the service is normally arranged following\
  \ contact with NHS 24. \r \r The recent trend data is shown by age group, sex and\
  \ broad deprivation category (SIMD). Information is also available at different\
  \ levels of geographical breakdown such as Health Boards, Health and Social Care\
  \ partnerships, and Scotland totals. \r \r This data is also available on the [COVID-19\
  \ Wider Impact Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/).\r\
