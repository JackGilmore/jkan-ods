notes: <p>Most councils will keep a record of their recycling and waste management
  facilities. Therefore we have tried to compile these into a consistent national
  layer.\r\n\r\nThe layer contains Recycling Places (including locations of bins and
  centres) and Waste Management Sites (including transfer centres and current/historic
  landfill sites). Both are a point layer (any provided polygons will have a centroid
  created).</p>
