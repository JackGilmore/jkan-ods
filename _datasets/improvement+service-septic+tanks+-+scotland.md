notes: <p>This dataset is an amalgamation of licenced SEPA &amp; some Local Authority
  Septic Tanks in Scotland.\n\nUnder section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act
  1990 and Under part 6, section 37 of the Water Resources (Scotland) Act 2013 SEPA,
  Scottish Water and Local Authorities all have a responsibility for the registration,
  management and compliance of Septic Tanks within Scotland. The Scottish Assessors
  also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that serve more than
  one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated as an appurtenance
  of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated as being reflected
  in the Council Tax band.\n\nSEPA have approximately a quarter of the Septic Tanks
  mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying or selling
  a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information (not included
  as data not provided in a suitable format) and Scottish Assessors collect some as
  well (not included due to percieved licensing restrictions). SEPA, Local Authorities,
  Scottish Water and Scottish Assessors are keen to combine data to create a complete
  and comprehensive view of all Septic Tanks in Scotland.</p>
