license: "**This group details the output from transport monitoring of cyclist and\
  \ pedestrian activity within Stirling.**\r \r **Outputs from the monitors feed into\
  \ Stirling Council\u2019s **[**Local Transport Strategy (LTS)**](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/)**.**\r\
  \ \r **Cycle and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side\
  \ of footways and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and\
  \ cyclists using piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise\
  \ any data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.**\r \r **The\
  \ movements which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified\
  \ based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red\
  \ beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.\
  \  Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the\
  \ movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface\
  \ of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.**\r \r **In August\
  \ 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with\
  \ the addition of three sites around Craig\u2019s Roundabout. These were installed\
  \ to allow the figures generated from them to be combined with those from the Kerse\
  \ Road Bridge to provide origin-destination data for the network of pathways going\
  \ through the roundabout.**\r \r [**Traffic Scotland **](https://trafficscotland.org/)\
  \ **can provide updates on any road closures and the **[**Scottish Roadworks Commissioner\
  \ **](https://www.roadworksscotland.org/)**can give further details on any planned\
  \ roadworks throughout the country.**\r "
