license: "This dataset provides information on number of new daily confirmed cases,\
  \ negative cases, deaths, testing by NHS Labs (Pillar 1) and UK Government (Pillar\
  \ 2), new hospital admissions, new ICU admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy\
  \ from novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Scotland, including cumulative totals and\
  \ population rates at Scotland, NHS Board and Council Area levels (where possible).\
  \ Seven day positive cases and population rates are also presented by Neighbourhood\
  \ Area (Intermediate Zone 2011). Information on how PHS publish small are COVID\
  \ figures is available on the\u202F[PHS website](https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/how-we-publish-small-area-covid-figures/).\
  \ \r \r Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic\
  \ by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread of COVID-19\
  \ within communities in the UK. \r \r  \r Public Health Scotland no longer reports\
  \ the number of COVID-19 deaths within 28 days of a first positive test from 2nd\
  \ June 2022. Please refer to\u202F[NRS death certificate data](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland)\u202F\
  as the single source for COVID-19 deaths data in Scotland. \r  \r To allow new data\
  \ to be fully processed and available at 12:00 on a Wednesday, the Daily COVID-19\
  \ in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily\
  \ unavailable from 11:00 to 12:00. During this window, the datasets will not be\
  \ visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found\
  \ error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual. \r\
  \ \r In the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting to include reinfections,\
  \ we have had to review existing methodology. In order to provide the best possible\
  \ linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required\
  \ to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID\
  \ positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge\
  \ date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge\
  \ information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated. Estimating\
  \ a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with\
  \ missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests.\
  \ \r \r The result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic\
  \ COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle\
  \ missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative\
  \ total with the inclusion of reinfections. \r \r COVID-19 hospital admissions are\
  \ now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of\
  \ the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19\
  \ up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or\
  \ during their stay in hospital. If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of\
  \ the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they\
  \ are not included in the analysis. \r \r Information on COVID-19, including stay\
  \ at home advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be\
  \ found on\u202F[NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice).\
