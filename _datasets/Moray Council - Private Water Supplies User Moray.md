notes: Private Water Supplies User (Moray)Reg 2 (previously Cat A) are supplies which
  are commercial (including private lets) or more than 50 persons Category B are non-commercial
  with less than 50 persons.NOTE:- The location data we hold for the private water
  supplies is not 100% accurate (easting's and northing's can be out but we are currently
  working on improving these through GPS, unfortunately I cannot provide a figure
  on the accuracy, some maybe just in a general area of the property it serves).The
  data may contain multiple records for the same source reference, this may be where
  either multiple source abstractions points are located or there are other private
  water supply infrastructure located eg storage tanks. The location Type indicates
  the type:- A or A1 etc = Source, B or B1 etc = supply infrastructure, U or U1 etc
  = unused supply infrastructure. Sites marked with "Y" confirmed are for sites where
  we have visited site and obtained more accurate locations. The list does not include
  historic private water supplies. The data is provided based on the best information
  available to the council at the time of writing.
