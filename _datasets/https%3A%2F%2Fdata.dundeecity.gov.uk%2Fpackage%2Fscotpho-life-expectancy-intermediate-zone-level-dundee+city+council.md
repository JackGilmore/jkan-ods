  \ Health Scotland produce estimated life expectancy figures at birth for females\
  \ and males expressed as a five-year average for each Intermediate Zone in Scotland.\
  \ The ScotPHO website contains a range of health statistics and can be accessed\
  \ by clicking on the following link:\r \r https://www.scotpho.org.uk/\r \r The Scottish\
  \ Government define an Intermediate Zone as a statistical geography that sits between\
  \ Data Zones and council areas. Intermediate Zones are often used for the dissemination\
  \ of statistics that are not suitable for release at Data Zone level because of\
  \ the sensitive nature of the statistic, or for reasons of reliability. Intermediate\
  \ Zones were designed to meet constraints on population thresholds (2,500 - 6,000\
  \ household residents), to nest within council areas, and to be built up from aggregates\
  \ of Data Zones. Intermediate Zones also represent a relatively stable geography\
  \ that can be used to analyse change over time, with changes only occurring after\
  \ a Census. The data in this data set is based on the 2011 Intermediate zones which\
  \ splits the whole of Scotland into 1,279 Intermediate Zones of which 31 are within\
  \ Dundee City.\r \r This dataset is sourced from the ScotPHO website and contains\
  \ the 5-year average life expectancy estimates for females and males at birth for\
  \ each of the Intermediate Zones in Dundee City. Life Expectancy data for other\
  \ areas within Scotland are available on the ScotPHO website and can be accessed\
