    Council Register of Assets (Moray).  Section 94 of the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 (the Act) requires public authorities to make available to members of the public a register of land that it owns or leases “to the best of its knowledge and belief”.  The purpose of the register is to help Community Transfer Bodies identify assets that may be available through asset transfer under Part 5 of the Act.  The inclusion of an asset on the register is a requirement of the Act and does not necessarily imply that the Council is actively seeking to transfer that asset to the community.
