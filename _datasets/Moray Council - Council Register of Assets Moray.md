notes: "Council Register of Assets (Moray).\_ Section 94 of the Community Empowerment\
  \ (Scotland) Act 2015 (the Act) requires public authorities to make available to\
  \ members of the public a register of land that it owns or leases \u201Cto the best\
  \ of its knowledge and belief\u201D.\_ The purpose of the register is to help Community\
  \ Transfer Bodies identify assets that may be available through asset transfer under\
  \ Part 5 of the Act.\_ The inclusion of an asset on the register is a requirement\
  \ of the Act and does not necessarily imply that the Council is actively seeking\
  \ to transfer that asset to the community."
