notes: Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) are served by the council to protect individual
  and groups of trees which are considered of sufficient merit to warrant formal protection
  either for their contribution to the setting of the landscape/ built environment
  or where the tree itself is considered to be of interest either as an example of
  its species or of local / historic interest.
