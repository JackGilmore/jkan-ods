notes: The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development Plan
  2020 on 27 July 2020.Local Development Plan Rural Grouping Designations have been
  set out within many of the Local Development Plan Rural Groupings. Sites with development
  potential have been identified. These are acceptable in principle subject to compliance
  with the Moray Local Development Plan (MLDP) 2015, but will still require confirmation
  of technical requirements (eg road access; drainage).These designations do not imply
  any right of access or use of private land, nor do they commit the Council to any
  form of maintenance or upkeep of the site.
