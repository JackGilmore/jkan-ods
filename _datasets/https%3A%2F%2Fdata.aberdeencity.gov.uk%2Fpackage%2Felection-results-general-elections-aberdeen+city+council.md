license: "The current UK Parliament constituencies were set in 2005.  The majority\
  \ of the Aberdeen City area falls within 2 constituencies:\r \r - **Aberdeen North**\r\
  \ - **Aberdeen South**\r \r Aberdeen City Council is responsible for organising\
  \ general election ballots within these constituencies and is therefore able to\
  \ share the election results (including votes cast per candidate and rejected ballots)\
  \ as open data.  More information about elections and voting within Aberdeen is\
  \ available on the [Council and Democracy section of the **Aberdeen City Council**\
  \ website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy).\r \r\
  \ A large part of the north of Aberdeen City, including Dyce and some parts of Bucksburn,\
  \ falls within the **Gordon** constituency where general election ballots are administrated\
  \ by Aberdeenshire Council.  Detailed results for Gordon, and the other constituencies\
  \ administrated by Aberdeenshire Council can be found on the [elections section\
  \ of the Aberdeenshire Council website](https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/).\r\
  \ \r For more information on UK Parliamentary Constituencies see the [Boundary Commission\
  \ for Scotland website](https://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/).   \r \r\
