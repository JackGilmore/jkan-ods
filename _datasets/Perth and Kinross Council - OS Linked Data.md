notes: 'Linked Data is a growing part of the Web where data is published on the Web
  and then linked to other published data in much the same way that web pages are
  interlinked using hypertext.


  OS Linked Data site takes some of the OS OpenData products and produces them in
  machine readable languages and publishes them in this easy to use website for all
  users to enjoy.'
