license: "The Roll of Honour for the **Great War** (later known as World War I or\
  \ WWI) was compiled by the City Assessor, Mr H. G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were\
  \ sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives\
  \ who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included\
  \ rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of\
  \ any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine**\
  \ (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity\
  \ supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned\
  \ to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many\
  \ separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds\
  \ and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications\
  \ existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   \r \
  \    \r Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during\
  \ **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two:\
  \ **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different\
  \ information.    \r     \r The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI\
  \ and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost\
  \ in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives\
  \ in Northern Ireland, for example.    \r     \r The transcripts are an attempt\
  \ to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City\u2019s Rolls of Honour.\
  \ Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen\
  \ Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can\
  \ be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).  Links to the [Aberdeen\
