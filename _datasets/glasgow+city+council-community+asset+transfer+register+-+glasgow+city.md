notes: '<p>This dataset includes data related to the Community Empowerment (Scotland)
  Act 2015 and the new duties this places on local authorities.\r\n\r\nPart 5: Asset
  Transfer Requests: Provides community bodies with a right to request to purchase,
  lease, manage or use land and buildings belonging to local authorities. Local authorities
  are required to create and maintain a register of land which they will make available
  to the public.\r\n\r\nPart 8: Common Good Property: Places a statutory duty on local
  authorities to establish and maintain a register of all property held by them for
  the common good. It also requires local authorities to publish their proposals and
  consult community bodies before disposing of or changing the use of common good
  assets.\r\n\r\nPart 9: Allotments: It requires local authorities to take reasonable
  steps to provide allotments if waiting lists exceed certain trigger points and strengthens
  the protection for allotments. Provisions allow allotments to be 250 square metres
  in size or a different size that is to be agreed between the person requesting an
  allotment and the local authority. The Act also requires fair rents to be set and
  allows tenants to sell surplus produce grown on an allotment (other than with a
  view to making a profit). There is a requirement for local authorities to develop
  a food growing strategy for their area, including identifying land that may be used
  as allotment sites and identifying other areas of land that could be used by a community
  for the cultivation of vegetables, fruit, herbs or flowers.\r\n\r\n"UPRN", "address"
  and "type" are now MANDATORY fields for this dataset. The "type" field should follow
  the One Scotland Gazetteer (OSG) Classification conventions. See https://bit.ly/2Tm9W6x
  for more details.\r\n\r\nSG have provided useful guidance of what the register should
  contain and how it should be formatted (pages 21-23). See https://dtascommunityownership.org.uk/sites/default/files/Asset%20Transfer%20RA%20Guidance%20Notes.pdf</p>'
