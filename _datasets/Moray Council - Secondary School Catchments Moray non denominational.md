organization: Moray Council
notes: >-
      In Moray, the education authority discharges its duty to secure adequate and efficient education for the local authority area by operating a “catchment area” system to enable parents/carers to comply with their duty to provide efficient education for their child(ren).  The zones (catchment areas) are shown as delineated areas on maps.  Information on these catchment areas is available at the Moray Council website.  Most parents of children living within the catchment area will choose for their children to attend the designated primary and secondary school for their catchment area.  If a parent wishes their child to be enrolled at a school which is not the designated catchment area school for their postal address, they must make an out-of-zone ‘placing request’.
