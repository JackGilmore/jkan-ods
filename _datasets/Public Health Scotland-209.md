notes: "<p>Data reflecting the time a patient waits between being referred for drug\
  \ and/or alcohol treatment and recieving their first treatment appointment. The\
  \ Scottish Government set a standard that 90% of people referred for help with their\
  \ drug or alcohol problem will wait no longer than three weeks for treatment that\
  \ supports their recovery.</p>\n<p>All publications and supporting material to this\
  \ topic area can be found on the <a href=\"https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/lifestyle-and-behaviours/substance-use/\"\
  >PHS Data and Intelligence - Substance Use</a> page. The date of the next release\
  \ can be found on our list of <a href=\"https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/\"\
  >forthcoming publications</a>.</p>\n<p>On 1st December 2020 NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran,\
  \ NHS Dumfries &amp; Galloway, NHS Grampian, and NHS Western Isles began using the\
  \ Drug and Alcohol Information System (DAISy), a new national database for Scotland.\
  \ It is expected that the remaining NHS Boards will transfer to DAISy in April 2021.\
  \ DAISy holds data in relation to drug and alcohol treatments and waiting times\
  \ from services throughout Scotland delivering tier 3 and 4 interventions. DAISy\
  \ replaces the previous systems:</p>\n<p>\u2022   Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Waiting\
  \ Times (DATWT)</p>\n<p>\u2022   Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD)</p>\n<p>In\
  \ order to allow sufficient time for quality assurance work to be undertaken, data\
  \ for referrals received during December 2020 for the above 4 NHS Boards has not\
  \ been included in this data. Information for October to December will be revised\
  \ in the next publication which is due to be published in June 2021.</p>"
