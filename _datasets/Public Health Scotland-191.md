  <p>On 18 November 2021 dose3/booster uptake figures were published by JCVI Priority\
  \ Groups.  PHS have reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18/11/2021,\
  \ specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for\
  \ the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each\
  \ group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to\
  \ be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect\
  \ the current living population.</p>\n<p>This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations\
  \ have changed for both numerator and denominators.  The greatest change is in All\
  \ Care Home Residents, Frontline Health and Social Care Workers, and Care Home Staff.\
  \  These were the 3 indicators that least represented the current population and\
  \ the method of reporting has now changed to reflect the current living population\
  \ in each cohort, in line with the other JCVI groups.</p>\n<p>On 08 December 2020,\
  \ a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was\
  \ first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca\
  \ (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout\
  \ of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved\
  \ for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.</p>\n\
  <p>These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness\
  \ set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency\
  \ (MHRA). </p>\n<p>Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive\
  \ the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the\
  \ independent advice received from the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf\"\
  >Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)</a> and prioritised delivery\
  \ of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended\
  \ order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been\
  \ adopted. </p>\n<p>Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group\
  \ resource can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b\"\
  >JCVI Priority Group Definitions table</a>. Individuals can appear in more than\
  \ one JCVI priority group.</p>\n<p>A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the\
  \ vaccines, followed by a booster dose for those aged 40+ or in certain JCVI priority\
  \ groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can\
  \ be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria)\
  \ and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after\
  \ the first dose.  Booster doses are offered 24 weeks after 2nd dose.  Those are\
  \ in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose\
  \ before being eligible for a booster.\nThis dataset provides information on daily\
  \ number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations\
  \ in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by\
  \ sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As\
  \ the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when\
  \ updated data are available.</p>\n<p>Additional data sources relating to this topic\
