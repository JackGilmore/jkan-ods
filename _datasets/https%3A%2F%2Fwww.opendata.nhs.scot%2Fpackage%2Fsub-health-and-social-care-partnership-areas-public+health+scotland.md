license: "Defined in the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014 as a smaller\
  \ area within the borders of a Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP).\r \r Each\
  \ sub area (also referred to as Locality or Community Partnership) has been agreed\
  \ in consultation with local professionals and communities and relates to natural\
  \ communities. Locations of GP practices are taken into account. They vary in size\
  \ according to local circumstances.\r \r Methods of creating the Sub Areas vary\
  \ between HSCPs and include use of building-block geographies, use of best-fit building-block\
  \ geographies, communities and drawing lines on a map. \r \r Within some HSCP Sub\
  \ Areas are then aggregated to form larger administrative or operational geographies,\
  \ which are also made available if sent from source. \r "
