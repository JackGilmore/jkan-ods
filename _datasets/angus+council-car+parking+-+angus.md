notes: <p>Most councils will keep a record of their car parks, bays and zones. Therefore
  we have tried to compile these into consistent national layers.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  we publish three layers:\r\n- Car Parks - a polygon layer\r\n- Parking Bays - a
  polygon layer\r\n- Parking Zones - a polygon layer\r\n\r\nAny supplied point records
  have been buffered (bays by 2m, car parks by 10m) to create a representative area,
  allowing them to be incorporated in the national dataset</p>
