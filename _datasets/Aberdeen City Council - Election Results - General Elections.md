title: Election Results - General Elections
organization: Aberdeen City Council
notes: >-
    The current UK Parliament constituencies were set in 2005.  The majority of the Aberdeen City area falls within 2 constituencies:

    - **Aberdeen North**
    - **Aberdeen South**

    Aberdeen City Council is responsible for organising general election ballots within these constituencies and is therefore able to share the election results (including votes cast per candidate and rejected ballots) as open data.  More information about elections and voting within Aberdeen is available on the [Council and Democracy section of the **Aberdeen City Council** website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy).

    A large part of the north of Aberdeen City, including Dyce and some parts of Bucksburn, falls within the **Gordon** constituency where general election ballots are administrated by Aberdeenshire Council.  Detailed results for Gordon, and the other constituencies administrated by Aberdeenshire Council can be found on the [elections section of the Aberdeenshire Council website](https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/).

    For more information on UK Parliamentary Constituencies see the [Boundary Commission for Scotland website](https://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/).
