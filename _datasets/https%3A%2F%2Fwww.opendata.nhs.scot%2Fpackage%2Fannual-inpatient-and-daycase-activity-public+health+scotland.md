license: "Inpatients refer to people who are admitted to an available staffed bed\
  \ in a hospital (either electively or as an emergency) and either: remain overnight\
  \ whatever the original intention; or are expected to remain overnight but are discharged\
  \ earlier. Day cases refer to episodes where a person makes a planned admission\
  \ to an available staffed bed in a hospital for clinical care, and requires the\
  \ use of a bed (or trolley in lieu of a bed). For the purposes of national data,\
  \ a day case episode refers to a patient who is admitted as a day case and is discharged\
  \ on the same day as planned.\r \r For further information on procedures, see the\
  \ [Operations/Procedures](https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/health-services/hospital-care/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/29-september-2020)\
  \ section of the Public Health Scotland website.\r \r Further information on outpatient\
  \ activity can be found in the [recent annual publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/acute-hospital-activity-and-nhs-beds-information-annual/).\
  \ \r \r The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
  \ \r __As part of making our open data output align better with our annual publication\
  \ tables, we will be adding health board of treatment column and qualifier columns\
  \ (HB, HBQF) to the \u201CInpatient and Day case\u201D and \u201COutpatient\u201D\
  \ files which have a breakdown by Location of Treatment.\r These new columns will\
  \ be in the position of the location columns and location  and remaining columns\
  \ will move two columns to the right.__\r \r __In our next annual open data, we\
  \ will be adding the specialty grouping column and qualifier column (SpecialtyGrouping,\
  \ SpecialtyGroupingQF) to the \u201CBeds\u201D, \u201CInpatient and Day case\u201D\
  \ and \u201COutpatient\u201D files which have a breakdown by Specialty. These new\
  \ columns will be in the two positions to the right of theSpecialtyNameQF column\
  \ and  the remaining columns will move two columns to the right.__\r \r __As part\
  \ of making our open data output align better with our annual publication tables,\
  \ we will be applying column ordering to the Inpatient, Outpatient and Beds files\
  \ in the next annual open data release consistent with the publication excel tables.__"
