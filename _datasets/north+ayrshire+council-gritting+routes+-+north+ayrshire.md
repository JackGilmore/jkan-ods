notes: <p>Each local authority creates gritting routes and regimes to keep their most
  important roads (and in some cases footpaths) and networks clear come bad winter
  weather. Most LAs create this as a line dataset. So the national dataset is a line
  format dataset. Some LAs collect this data as a polygon dataset. We are working
  with them to convert this into line formats in the future.\r\n\r\nWe have removed
  trunk roads that are cleared by private companies e.g BEAR and AMEY from this dataset
  for the time being as they aren't currently under the LA gritting route regime.\r\n\r\nEventually,
  the Street Gazetteer will enable us to identify these routes more accurately and
  coherently.</p>
