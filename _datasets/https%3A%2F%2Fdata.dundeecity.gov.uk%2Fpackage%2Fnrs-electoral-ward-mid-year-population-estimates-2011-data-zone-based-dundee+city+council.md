license: "National Records of Scotland publish mid year electoral ward population\
  \ estimates on an annual basis.\r The mid year population estimates for the electoral\
  \ wards are based on the data zone based population estimates. NRS have used a best\
  \ fit methodology to assign each data zone to a particular electoral ward. \r \r\
  \ NRS have published a methodology paper on their website which explains in detail\
  \ how the electoral ward based population estimates were created as well as supplying\
  \ links to further information. The document states that electoral ward population\
  \ estimates are based on small area population estimates which are used to assign\
  \ the 2011 data zones to a particular electoral ward. 2011 data zones do not fit\
  \ exactly into electoral ward boundaries and are allocated on a \"best fit\" basis.\
  \ Where a data zone crosses the boundary of two or more electoral wards it is allocated\
  \ to the one that contains the population-weighted centroid of the data zone.\r\
  \ \r The most recent electoral ward population estimates for the period 2001-2021\
  \ as well as the publication methodology document is available on the National Records\
  \ of Scotland Website and can be accessed by clicking on the link below:\r \r https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/electoral-ward-population-estimates\r\
