notes: >-
    Bill Gibb (1943-1988), born in **New Pitsligo**, Aberdeenshire, was an **international fashion designer** with world famous clients. In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   
       
    In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.
