license: "This dataset shows the latest results of the Public Health Scotland (PHS)\
  \ serology surveillance programme. The PHS serology surveillance programme uses\
  \ existing blood samples within community healthcare and other settings to estimate\
  \ the proportion of people who have antibodies to coronavirus (\"seroprevalence\"\
  ) in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. Antibodies\
  \ can be used to identify individuals who have had COVID-19 infection in the past\
  \ or have developed antibodies as a result of vaccination.\r \r This data is also\
  \ available on the Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19 in Scotland Dashboard along\
  \ with detailed commentary and background information on interpreting the data.\
  \ The dashboard can be accessed from the [Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19 in Scotland\
  \ publication](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/enhanced-surveillance-of-covid-19-in-scotland/)\
  \ page. The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\
  \ Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links\
  \ section of the Metadata below. Information on COVID-19, including stay at home\
  \ advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be found on\
  \ [NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice).\r\
  \ \r __Revisions have been made to our antenatal data: from week beginning 7th June\
  \ 2021 (ISO week 23 of 2021), we can detect which antibodies are from vaccination\
  \ and which are from infection (+/- vaccination). These changes can be seen in the\
  \ dashboard publications from 10th November 2021 onwards. More detail regarding\
  \ these changes can be found in the notes section of the dashboard.__"
