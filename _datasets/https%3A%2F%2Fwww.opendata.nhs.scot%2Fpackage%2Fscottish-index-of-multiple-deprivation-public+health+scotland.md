license: "Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) splits Scotland into data\
  \ zones which are given ranking from most deprived to least deprived.\r \r This\
  \ data set contains population weighted quintiles and deciles for health board,\
  \ council area, and health and social care partnership where appropriate. Also available\
  \ is an indicator as to whether a data zone is in the 15% most deprived or 15% least\
  \ deprived data zones in Scotland.\r \r SIMD is based on a number of indicators:\r\
  \ \r * Access to Services\r \r * Crime\r \r * Education\r \r * Employment\r \r *\
  \ Health\r \r * Housing\r \r * Income\r \r Note: An area may be classed as deprived\
  \ but residents may not be deprived, and an area may be classed as not deprived\
  \ but this doesn't mean residents are not deprived. SIMD is not a tool for saying\
  \ __how much more__ deprived one area is from another."
