notes: <p>The Hands Up Scotland Survey looks at how pupils across the country travel
  to school and nursery.\r\n\r\nThe project is funded by Transport Scotland and is
  a joint survey between Sustrans and all 32 Scottish local authorities.\r\n\r\nEach
  September, schools across Scotland complete the survey by asking their pupils \u2018How
  do you normally travel to school?\u2019. Council staff distribute the survey to
  schools and return pupil responses to the Sustrans\u2019 Research and Monitoring
  Unit for overall collation, analysis and reporting.\r\n\r\nThe most recent results,
  published on 24th June 2021 in the 2020 Annual Report, provide a valuable snapshot
  of school travel in Scotland.</p>
