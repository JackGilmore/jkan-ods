notes: <p>An adaptation from Scotland's official statistics giving house prices in
  Perth and Kinross by intermediate Zones, a statistical geography created for use
  with the Scottish Neighborhood Statistics (SNS) programme and the wider public sector.
  Intermediate Zones represent 2,500 - 6,000 household residents, and are a relatively
  stable geography that can be used to analyse change over time, with changes only
  occurring after a Census.</p>
