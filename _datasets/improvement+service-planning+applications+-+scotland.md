notes: '<p>''Development management'' is the name given to the process of deciding
  planning applications and various other associated activities including enforcement
  of planning controls. For the purposes of planning applications, development in
  Scotland is put into one of three categories \u2013 ''local'', ''major'' or ''national''.
  The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited
  to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely
  to raise. Most applications will be for ''local'' developments. ''Major'' developments
  include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related
  developments, and larger retail developments. ''National'' developments are specific
  projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of
  their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority
  of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.\n\nThis
  dataset consists of 3 separate layers: \n\n1. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists
  (Points):\xa0\xa0A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year''s
  weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered
  and/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across
  Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding\xa0geometry.
  This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly
  list.\n2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons):\xa0A polygon layer showing
  an amalgamation of the current calendar year''s weekly lists for most Scottish\xa0planning\xa0authorities
  in terms of\xa0applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This
  is only for authorities that publish site boundary\xa0mapping data online.\xa0This
  is\xa0categorised\xa0by application status, planning authority and date of weekly
  list.\n3. Planning Applications - historic year layers back to 1990 (Polygons):\xa0Polygon
  layers for all previous year''s planning applications with summary details for\xa0most\xa0Scottish\xa0planning\xa0authorities.
  This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\xa0mapping data online and
  is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered for individual year
  by selecting the ''shapefile'' or ''GeoJSON'' download option or the Web Feature
  Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS.\n\nThis
  data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists) and this metadata record
  is updated weekly.\n\nWe strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset,
  because of it''s size you should use it with a filter.\n\n<em>Moray and Aberdeenshire''s
  planning data has currently been removed from this dataset. We will find a solution
  to this in due course</em></p>'
