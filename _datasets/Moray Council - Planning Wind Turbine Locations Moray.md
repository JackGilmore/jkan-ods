notes: Wind turbine locations generated from planning applications received by Moray
  Council this includes applications Moray Council dealt with and Section 36 applications
  which were dealt with by Scottish Government. It also includes refused applications,
  some of the refused applications maybe appealed. Some applications maybe for the
  same site where the applicant has submitted a revised application to change turbine
  size/location etc.Any turbine location co-ordinates we provide will not be exact
  locations taken from GPS or similar. The co-ordinates will be either calculated
  from plans provide by the applicant or grid co-ordinates stated in the application,
  these co-ordinates will not take into account for any micro-siting at construction
  stage. The data is provided based on the best information available to the council
  at the time of writing.
