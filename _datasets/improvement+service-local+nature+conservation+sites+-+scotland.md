notes: <p>Local nature conservation sites (LNCS) is a non-statutory designation given
  by local authorities to areas of locally important nature and landscapes. NatureScot,
  on behalf of the Local Nature Conservation Sites Working Group, published guidance
  (https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-nature-conservation-sites)
  for local authorities on the establishment and management of LNCS systems in Scotland.
  \n\nOne of the LNCS working group's recommendations was that all local authorities
  should adopt the LNCS name in place of the many different local names. However,
  many councils still use alternative names for these sites such as Local Biodiversity
  Sites, Local Wildlife Sites, Local Geodiversity Sites and Sites of Interest for
  Nature Conservation. We have merged these all into this national dataset.\n\nSeveral
  LAs are still to confirm and digitise their LNCSs.</p>
