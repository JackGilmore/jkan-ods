notes: <p>Percentage of premises that have Ultrafast Broadband coverage (300Mbit/s
  or greater) Sourced from Connected Nations Report by Ofcom.  Data collected and
  analysed from major fixed telecoms operators (BT, Virgin, Sky, Talk Talk, Vodafone
  and KCOM).  Contains Broadband Coverage from the operators aggregated at 2011 Census
  output area level (SNS Datazones). The coverage data was collected as a snapshot
  in January 2018. Due to variations in broadband performance over time, the file
  should not be regarded as a definitive and fixed view of the UK's fixed broadband
  infrastructure. However, the information provided in this file may be useful in
  identifying variations in broadband availability. More information from - https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/infrastructure-research/connected-nations-update-spring-2018</p>
