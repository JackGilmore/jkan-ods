license: "This release presents data on quit attempts made with the help of NHS stop\
  \ smoking services during the financial years, 2009/10 \u2013 2019/20, and the outcomes\
  \ of those quit attempts. Information is presented at national, NHS Board and Local\
  \ Authority level along with breakdowns including age, gender, and deprivation.\
  \ Statistics are based on total \u2018quit attempts\u2019 made during the year,\
  \ rather than total number of clients with a quit attempt, so could include repeat\
  \ quit attempts for the same client. \r \r All publications and supporting material\
  \ to this topic area can be found on the [Public Health Scotland website](https://beta.isdscotland.org/topics/smoking-cessation/).\
  \ Further information on smoking cessation can be found in the [annual publication](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/nhs-smoking-cessation-service-statistics-scotland/).\
  \ The date of the next release can be found on our list of [forthcoming publications](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/forthcoming-publications/).\r\
