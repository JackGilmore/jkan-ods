notes: <p>A council development plan may designate a green belt around a city or town
  to support the spatial strategy by:\r\n- directing development to the most appropriate
  locations and supporting regeneration;\r\n- protecting and enhancing the character,
  landscape setting and identity of the settlement; and\r\n- protecting and providing
  access to open space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </p>
