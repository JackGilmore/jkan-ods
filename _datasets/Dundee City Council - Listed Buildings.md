notes: "Buildings are listed by Historic Scotland for their special architectural\
  \ or historic interest on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim of listing\
  \ such buildings is to protect or enhance their special character by affording them\
  \ statutory protection. The principles for listing buildings are fairly complex\
  \ and there is no right of appeal against the Scottish Governments decision to list\
  \ a property. Listed buildings are listed in 3 categories - A, B and C;\n\n* __Category\
  \ A__ listed buildings are of national or international importance. \n* __Category\
  \ B__ listed buildings are of regional importance. \n* __Category C__ buildings\
  \ are of local importance. \n\nA building's listing covers its interior, exterior\
  \ and any object or structure fixed to a building or which falls within the curtilage\
  \ of such a building, forming part of the land since before 1 July 1948.\n\nVisit\
  \ the Council website for information about [listed buildings and the planning process](Further\
  \ information on listed buildings can be found on the ).  You can also visit [Historic\
  \ Environment Scotland for national data](https://www.historicenvironment.scot/advice-and-support/listing-scheduling-and-designations/listed-buildings/search-for-a-listed-building/)\
