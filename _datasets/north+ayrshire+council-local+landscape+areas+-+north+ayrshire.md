notes: <p>There are many areas where the scenery is highly valued locally and local
  authorities often give these landscapes a local designation. This is to ensure that
  the landscape is not damaged by inappropriate development, and in some cases encourage
  positive landscape management. These designations play an important role in developing
  an awareness of the landscape qualities that make particular areas distinctive and
  promote a community's sense of pride in their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe names used
  for such Local Landscape Areas currently vary from one local authority to another.
  For example, they are termed 'Areas of Great Landscape Value' in Moray, 'Special
  Landscape Areas' in Dumfries and Galloway, and 'Sensitive Landscape Character Areas'
  in Ayrshire. Guidance published by NatureScot and Historic Environment Scotland
  (see below) suggests the name be standardised to Local Landscape Areas (LLA) now.
  LLAs complement the National Scenic Area designation, which identifies those landscapes
  that are seen as nationally important owing to their unsurpassed scenery.\r\nhttps://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/local-landscape-areas\r\n\r\nSite
